# PlanetsLib: Tiers

This companion mod for PlanetsLib assigns 'tier values' to planets, rough indicators of where the planet fits in a vanilla-style game of Space Age. 

Tiers have no functionality by themselves, but are a rough indicator where the planet fits in a vanilla-style game of Space Age for the purposes of other mods that wish to use this information.

This mod is separate to PlanetsLib so that players can choose to update PlanetsLib without changing the tiers of planets on their save.

See [here](https://github.com/danielmartin0/factorio-PlanetsLib-Tiers/blob/main/tiers.lua) for the built-in tier list. Players are encouraged to submit edits to keep this list up-to-date.
